# VeriPharma

## Blockchain's potential extends beyond finance, offering meaningful solutions to support communities in essential industries healthcare.

### Inspiration
We were inspired by the grave impact of counterfeit drugs and the alarming rise of indistinguishable fakes, which pose serious risks to public health. Tragically, the people most impacted by these fraudulent pharmaceutical products are often those in need, yet unable to afford their retail price.

### What it does
VeriPharma leverages blockchain technology to bring transparency and peace of mind to the entire pharmaceutical supply chain, from production to the end user. Each drug is assigned a unique serial number, with its entire supply chain recorded immutably on the blockchain. This allows end users to easily verify the authenticity of their medications by inputting the serial number, ensuring that counterfeit or compromised drugs are swiftly identified and removed from the market, protecting public health.

### How we built it
We built a decentralized web application using Ethereum's Sepolia testnet for smart contract deployment. The core functionality revolves around several smart contracts that manage drug registration, supply chain transfer, verification, and flagging faulty batches. Stakeholders can use MetaMask to interact with the system, ensuring that every step of the supply chain is recorded immutably on the blockchain.
